# Rio Product Definition

## Purpose

Rio is a macOS meeting assistant for IBM employees. Bob helps with coding; Rio helps with meetings by listening to microphone and meeting audio and surfacing the technical information a support engineer is likely to need while a client troubleshooting call is still happening.

The insight stream is the product. Audio capture and speech-to-text are temporary implementation stages, not user-facing features.

## Audience

Rio is for people who want to stay engaged in meetings without operating a recorder, reading a transcript, or taking continuous notes. The first release is a focused technical preview for macOS 26+ on Macs that support Apple Intelligence.

It is not an enterprise recording platform, collaboration workspace, meeting archive, diagnostic authority, or autonomous operator.

## Core experience

The app opens to one clear listening control and a small status indicator.

Rio also remains available from the macOS menu bar while the app is running. The
menu-bar menu provides the same start/stop listening action as the main window,
plus Open Rio and Quit Rio actions. Closing the main window does not quit Rio;
the menu-bar item remains the way to reopen or quit the app.

While listening, Rio shows a compact live microphone input level so the user can tell that capture is active without exposing a transcript. The main window has one primary action: start listening or stop listening and clear the session. A concise cue explains that processing is temporary and on-device.

When the user starts listening:

1. Rio captures system/meeting audio and microphone audio.
2. Apple's Speech framework converts the live audio into temporary finalized text.
3. A bounded rolling text window is sent to Apple's on-device system language model.
4. The model returns structured incident-signal and insight updates.
5. The UI adds, updates, or removes concise cards as the support call develops.

For the incident-copilot evaluation target, the useful signal set is symptoms, errors, product/version/environment facts, recent changes, failed checks, and unanswered diagnostic questions. Rio may formulate intent for trusted local manuals and runbooks and offer evidence-grounded possible investigation directions and next-best questions. It does not state diagnoses as facts, infer action owners, fabricate source evidence, or execute automatic actions.

The app does not display a live transcript. Temporary transcript text is discarded as it leaves the rolling context window and is discarded completely when listening stops.

If no input is detected for a sustained period, the interface warns that the microphone may be muted. Capture or microphone failures are shown as explicit connection errors rather than as an apparently active listening state.

## Insight categories

The MVP surfaces:

- Important points and takeaways.
- Decisions.
- Action items.
- Open questions.
- Risks, blockers, and unresolved topics.

Each card contains a concise statement, its category, and a simple state such as new, updated, or resolved. Evidence text and transcript navigation are not required for the MVP.

Rio must not guess an action-item owner. It may include an owner only when the temporary meeting text explicitly names one; otherwise the owner remains unspecified.

## Apple Intelligence

The MVP uses the Foundation Models framework to access the on-device system language model that powers Apple Intelligence. Insight responses use guided generation to produce typed Swift values rather than free-form text that the app must parse.

When the app loads and before listening begins, Rio checks microphone access, speech recognition and its required assets, Apple Intelligence, and locale support. It shows all unavailable prerequisites together with the macOS action needed to resolve each one, so the user can fix the setup before trying again. Foundation Models reports Apple Intelligence as unavailable but does not disclose whether language alignment or organization policy is the cause. Rio therefore asks the user to review the compatibility message in System Settings rather than inferring a Mac or Siri language from the system locale; it does not change a system setting itself. The confirmation action opens the Apple Intelligence & Siri pane directly, falling back to System Settings if macOS declines that route. Apple Intelligence may be unavailable because the Mac is ineligible, the feature is disabled, required assets are not ready, the Mac and Siri languages do not match, organization policy restricts access, or the locale is unsupported. The MVP explains the condition and does not offer a cloud-model fallback.

When Foundation Models reports that Apple Intelligence is disabled, Rio shows a one-time, non-blocking notice explaining that enabling it downloads on-device models and requires several gigabytes of free disk space. Unsupported devices and models that are still downloading use their existing unavailable-state guidance instead.

Speech recognition is a separate native stage. SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber perform on-device speech-to-text suitable for meetings; Foundation Models then interprets that temporary text.

The current M1 implementation uses English (US) (`en-US`) for both speech recognition and meeting understanding regardless of the Mac's system locale. Locale selection is not yet a user-facing control.

## Data lifecycle

- Audio remains in memory only long enough to feed speech recognition.
- Audio is never intentionally written to disk.
- Finalized transcript segments live in a bounded rolling context window.
- Old text is continuously discarded.
- All temporary meeting text is discarded when listening stops.
- Current insight cards are session-only and disappear when the session ends unless a later product decision adds explicit insight export.
- No audio, transcript text, insight text, or secrets may appear in logs.

## Explicit exclusions

- Visible live transcription or transcript editing.
- Note-taking and document editing.
- Audio recording, playback, or persistent audio storage.
- Transcript export, automatic meeting history, or searchable archives.
- Meeting bots or joining calls on the user's behalf.
- Speaker identification, diarization, or guessed speaker ownership.
- OpenAI or another cloud-model fallback in the MVP.
- Accounts, calendars, CRM integrations, team workspaces, or cloud synchronization.
- Generic assistant chat, unrelated recommendations, or autonomous actions.
- Windows and Linux support in the MVP.

## Success criteria

The MVP is successful when:

1. A user can start and stop listening with one obvious action.
2. The app captures microphone and system audio from a real meeting after a clear permission flow.
3. Useful insight cards begin appearing during the meeting without exposing a transcript.
4. Duplicate insights are merged and changed conclusions update or replace stale cards.
5. An action-item owner is never inferred without explicit support in the temporary text.
6. Stopping listening promptly releases capture resources and clears temporary audio and text.
7. A one-hour meeting completes without deadlock, unrecovered capture failure, or unbounded memory growth.
8. The app clearly reports unavailable Apple Intelligence, unsupported language, denied permission, and interrupted capture states.
9. No meeting content is persisted or logged unintentionally.
